Common Causes

The filament isn’t sticking to the bed because the bed is too cold and the filament is cooling too fast, or because the bed isn’t sticky or grippy enough and the filament is having difficulties staying attached to the surface.

Solutions

Solution 1
Get blue painters tape, and lay down strips of it on the print bed before starting the print. This creates a surface that the filament is more likely to stick to.

Solution 2
Wipe your print bed with rubbing alcohol and let it dry before starting the print. This removes any residue or other substances that may have been stopping the filament from sticking to the bed.

Solution 3
Spray your print bed with hair spray before starting the print. This creates a much more secure surface that your filament should stick to better.

Solution 4
If your printer doesn’t have a separate heated bed, warm up your print bed with a hairdryer. This will allow your first layers to cool more slowly and consistently, and bond to the print better more securely.
